	<dt class="question" data-sort="general all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="1"></a></div>What is v17e?</dt>
	<p class="answer">v17e is the mobile optimized version of the v17 design system for ibm.com. It's a framework that will enable you to create a cohesive and engaging digital experience on the ibm.com domain. It's a foundation you can build on top of with extreme flexibility and efficiency. It's a set of tools and resources to help you focus on what really matters, the customer.<p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

	<dt class="question" data-sort="general designer all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="2"></a></div>How does v17e differ from v17?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Adaptive grids for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Other enhancements: updated jquery code, icons have been converted to fonts, IBM custom fonts, as well as new, adaptive modules.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top"> 
<a class="ibm-anchor-up-link" href="#ibm-content">Back to top</a>
    
    <dt class="question" data-sort="general owner all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="3"></a></div>What's new in v17e? (details)</dt>
    <dd class="answer">There are a few new classes and containers in v17e that you can use to improve your page appearance for mobile devices or just generally to tweak the page. Three biggies include 1) adding the ibm-resize class to an image tag allows the image to get smaller (or larger) as needed based on window size, 2) the ibm-band class puts an edge to edge band around ibm-columns, visually breaking the space into horizontal bands and opening up the space to the left and right of the content for use, and 3) ibm-sprite lets you have an image that looks different on mouse over or down using a single image (sprite).</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dt class="question" data-sort="developer all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="4"></a></div>How do I get started? How do I get access?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">If you’re interested in testing your site using v17e with an eye toward eventually rolling your site out using v17e, provide the following information to XYZ email address: Site name, Primary contact name and email address, approximate number of pages, sample URL. If you are interested in possibly being involved in the development of the core code that makes up v17e your development team can get started by contacting Jeff Florentino who will assess your skills and match to the project and if it makes sense grant you and your dev team access to the v17_enhanced SVN repository. Your developers should first get familiar with v17 code and elements found on the CDDS site. Once familiar, you will be set up to start coding with v17e.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top"> 
<a class="ibm-anchor-up-link" href="#ibm-content">Back to top</a></p>
    
    <dt class="question" data-sort="general all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="5"></a></div>Will non-mobile users benefit?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Yes, experience on desktop for retina screens has been improved. If a non-mobile user changes the size of the browser window the content will adjust/respond to that change. Additionally pages should load more quickly due to a number of changes.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top"> 
<a class="ibm-anchor-up-link" href="#ibm-content">Back to top</a></p>

    <dt class="question" data-sort="general owner developer all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="6"></a></div>Does v17e improve performance?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Improved performance is being delivered through a number of techniques including 1) splitting up the CSS file and only delivering the ones that are needed for the functions that are actually used on each page, 2) eliminating duplicate files on different ibm.com sites and combining different JS files so that there are fewer calls and better use of caching, 3) ensuring every file is compressed, 4) using CSS pre-processor to optimize CSS code, 5) changing graphical icons to fonts, 6) removing code and CSS that are no longer needed (including for V16) and 7) ensuring all centrally delivered JS and CSS files are delivered via Akamai's geographically distributed CDN Network of servers, to name a few.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top"> 
<a class="ibm-anchor-up-link" href="#ibm-content">Back to top</a></p>

    <dt class="question" data-sort="general all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="7"></a></div>Why weren't these improvements added to v17?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Many things have been rewritten from the ground up. Mandatory changes would have to be made to 100% of all ibm.com pages, and with the number of pages on v17 today, it would be impractical to coordinate and test all at once. For this reason it was determined that making this one mid-course correction (and adding in a large number of additional enhancements at the same time) is a more reasonable solution.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top"> 
<a class="ibm-anchor-up-link" href="#ibm-content">Back to top</a></p>

    <dt class="question" data-sort="general all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="8"></a></div>Is v17e a replacement for the 'Lite Blue' mobile proxy or can the two be used together?</dt>    
    <dd class="answer">Yes, v17e is replacing Lite Blue and no it is not compatible with the mobile proxy. If your site is currently using the mobile proxy, you will need to check and remove any go-mobile-type .js references.  Use &lt;link rel="IBM.Mobile.redirect" href="http://www.ibm.com/[UPDATE]/" />  to override 'Lite Blue', causing it to redirect users to an "alternate mobile version of a page."  The "[UPDATE]" portion of that URL should have the canonical URI for the page. That way, if the user accidentally lands at m.ibm.com, they will be redirected back to <a href="www.ibm.com">www.ibm.com</a> instead. To do all this you can learn more about [the Lite Blue proxy and the IBM.Mobile.redirect] and/or reach out to the IBM Corporate Webmasters for help.<p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dt class="question" data-sort="general all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="9"></a></div>What if I don't adopt v17e?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Migration to v17e is not currently required. You can continue to use v17 for now. At some point v17 may be discontinued or deprecated and at that time the terms and timing of adoption will be developed and communicated.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top"> 
<a class="ibm-anchor-up-link" href="#ibm-content">Back to top</a></p>

    <dt class="question" data-sort="general owner developer all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="10"></a></div>How much work is involved in changing a v17 page into a v17e page?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Depending on your pages, potentially not a lot of work. For example, these would be the minimal steps that would be needed to migrate a page to v17e. To take advantage of some advanced v17e functions will require some additional work. 
    	<ol>
    		<li>Add the viewport meta tag<br />
	    		e.g.<br />
	    		&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
    		</li>
    		<li>Change the .css file you are calling.</li>
    		<li>For non-DBCS pages, add the "ibm-type" class to the page's body tag (e.g. change the body tag from &lt;body id="ibm-com"> to &lt;body id="ibm-com" class="ibm-type">).  The "ibm-type" class applies the custom IBM fonts. This must not be applied to DBCS pages.</li>
    		<li>The default template (left nav template) now requires an "ibm-default" class<br />
    		e.g.<br />
    		 &lt;div id="ibm-top"&gt; would become &lt;div id="ibm-top" class="ibm-default"&gt;</li>
    		<li>If the page includes any of the following: a data table, list modules, form, application, and/or social icons for the content space, you'll need to add a call to the appropriate css file.</li>

    <dd class="answer">Now if you qualify, you can apply to be a part of the v17e pilot/beta test by contacting Pattern Lab Request/Somers/IBM and provide the following information to Pattern Lab Request/Somers/IBM: Site name, Primary contact name and email address, approximate number of pages, sample URL. </dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dd class="answer">If approved to be a part of the v17e pilot/beta test initial adoption involves migrating some sample pages to v17e to help ensure your site doesn’t have any problems. Once you are confident that your site works well with v17e you can request review of pages before publishing live. Additional there are still some things we need to do so as to be ready to have v17e pages in production. As v17e is still under development, as a part of the pilot/beta test you agree to follow the deploy schedule and retest prior to each release to ensure that any live pages will not be adversely affected.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dt class="question" data-sort="general owner developer all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="14"></a></div>When will v17e roll out?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Constantly. For the people already in pilot/beta test, v17e is live. v17e is an agile project and as such, the CSS and/or JS files are published regularly (approximately every 2 weeks).</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dt class="question" data-sort="general owner all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="15"></a></div>When will it be mandatory to be on v17e?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Mandatory migration is TBD. v17e is a prototype framework.  Eventually it is expected that the v17e changes will be incorporated into the follow-on to v17 (maybe named v18?) and at that time the terms and timing of adoption will be developed and communicated.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dt class="question" data-sort="developer all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="16"></a></div>How do I get started on SVN?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">If your team has requested and been granted approval to assist with the development of the v17e code Jeff Florentino, or another administrator of SVN, will grant you the appropriate access. Suggested software to use is 'Versions', to keep track of the different versions that are created. v17e contributors will also need a SASS compiler. You can either use the command prompt, CodeKit or prepros.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dd class="answer">Once you are granted access to SVN, you will then be able to download the appropriate JS and CSS files from the SVN directory. They are located at v17_enhanced/trunk/css and v17_enhanced/trunk/js. The production references are: &lt;link href="//1.www.s81c.com/common/v17e/css/ww.css" rel="stylesheet" title="www" type="text/css" /> and &lt;script src="//1.www.s81c.com/common/v17e/js/ww.js" type="text/javascript">&lt;/script></span>. jQuery and Modernizr are included as part of the common v17e JS.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

    <dd class="answer">Majority of Tablets (Nexus, iPad, Galaxy), phones (iPhone) and desktop are supported. Viewports are constantly being added centrally on an ongoing basis. Testing is as simple as accessing the dev server on your mobile device. You can also test it at <a href="www.resizr.com">Resizr</a>.

    <dt class="question" data-sort="developer all"><div class="ibm-anchor-pointer"><a name="20"></a></div>How do I modify or add my own custom components to v17e?</dt>
    <dd class="answer">Some sites, by their nature, may need to have custom components to accomplish their business needs. In v17e there is a way to add custom components. Custom components are added through a site specific CSS file (ww_cci.css). Inside of this file you can define the custom styles by using a '.ibm_cci-' prefix followed by the modified module (e.g. .ibm_cci-leadspace). All custom modules must be reviewed (by the v17e team) prior to start of coding and approved after coding is complete. Customizations that are approved can be added to your site specific ww_cci.css file.</dd><p class="ibm-ind-link ibm-back-to-top">

Participants in the v17e pilot/beta test must agree to follow the deploy schedule and retest prior to each release to ensure that any live pages will not be adversely affected.</dd>
