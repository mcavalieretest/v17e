But when IBM shared with them a model that helped them predict injuries with greater accuracy, analytics proved to be a gamechanger.</p><p>Now the Waratah’s analyze data collected from several sources (like accelerometers players wear that measure intensity levels, collisions and fatigue) to anticipate and avoid injuries, and also to come up with specific regimens to better train individual players. Injuries were once an unavoidable reality of sports; now data-driven teams can prevent them for a competitive advantage.</p>"
