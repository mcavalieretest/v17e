								<h4>The challenge</h4>
								<p>People expect companies to know who they are, how to engage with them and how to exceed their expectations, quickly. Case in point, research says that customers who contact a company via social media expect a response within five minutes. Companies doing all of the above will reap the benefits—it’s a fact that fully engaged customers deliver a 23% premium in share of wallet, profitability, revenue and relationship growth. That said, most organizations aren’t engaging with or meeting the needs of customers—when it’s never been easier to do so because of the availability of customer data.</p>
								<h4>Solution</h4>
								<p>Watson can transform the way people and companies interact with one another. Individual consumers can engage with Watson in plain English, directly. to get personalized answers to questions.</p>
								<p><span>The Nielsen Innovation Lab</span>, founded to advance research in advertising, intends to use <span>Watson Engagement Advisor</span> to explore ways it can help agencies and their clients better engage with consumers and increase the effect of their advertising and media plans. <a href="http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2013/05/exploring.html" target="_blank">Read more from Randall Beard</a> (Global Head, Advertiser Solutions, Nielsen).</p>
								<p>Barriers are lowered. Customers are served and engaged. Turnover is reduced. And new sales and relationship opportunities are created. Everyone wins.</p>

								<h4>The challenge</h4>
								<p>According to one expert, only 20 percent of the knowledge physicians use to diagnose and treat patients today is evidence based. Which means that one in five diagnoses is incorrect or incomplete.</p>
								<p>And consider that the amount of medical information available is doubling every five years and that much of this data is unstructured. Physicians simply don't have time to read every journal that can help them keep up to date with the latest advances. Given the growing complexity of medical decision making, how can healthcare providers address these problems?</p>
								<h4>Solution</h4>
								<p>Watson has the potential to transform healthcare research, how medical students learn and how payments are processed.</p>
								<p>Physicians can use Watson to assist in diagnosing and treating patients by having it analyze large amounts of unstructured text and develop hypotheses based on that analysis.</p>
								<p>First, the physician might describe symptoms and other related factors to the system. Watson can then identify the key pieces of information and mine the patient’s data to find relevant facts about family history, current medications and other existing conditions. It combines this information with current findings from tests, and then forms and tests hypotheses by examining a variety of data sources—treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data and doctors’ and nurses’ notes, as well as peer-reviewed research and clinical studies. From here, Watson can provide potential treatment options  and its confidence rating for each suggestion.</p>

								<h4>The challenge</h4>
								<p>The challenges the financial services industry faces are complex. Regulatory measures, as well as social and governmental pressure for financial institutions to be more inclusive, have increased. And customers the industry serves are more empowered, demanding and sophisticated than ever before.</p>
								<p>In addition, with so much financial information generated each day, it’s difficult to properly harness the right information to act upon. </p>
								<p>The solutions?  Deeper client engagement and a better understanding of risk profiles and the operating environment.
								</p>
								<h4>The Solution</h4>
								<p>Major financial institutions are already working with Watson to infuse additional intelligence into their business processes. Watson is tackling data-intensive challenges across the financial services sector, including banking, financial planning and investing.</p>
								<p>DBS Bank's relationship managers advise their wealth-management clients by analyzing large volumes of such complex data as research reports, product information, and customer profiles. DBS will apply Watson Engagement Advisor to analyze the relationship managers’ growing corpus of investment knowledge, identify connections to customers' needs, offer better advice and determine customers’ best financial options.</p>
