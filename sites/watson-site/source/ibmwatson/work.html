                                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                                <p>According to one expert, only 20 percent of the knowledge physicians use to diagnose and treat patients today is evidence based. Which means that one in five diagnoses is incorrect or incomplete.</p>
                                <p>And consider that the amount of medical information available is doubling every five years and that much of this data is unstructured. Physicians simply don't have time to read every journal that can help them keep up to date with the latest advances. Given the growing complexity of medical decision making, how can healthcare providers address these problems?</p>
                                <h4>Solution</h4>
                                <p>Watson has the potential to transform healthcare research, how medical students learn and how payments are processed.</p>
                                <p>Physicians can use Watson to assist in diagnosing and treating patients by having it analyze large amounts of unstructured text and develop hypotheses based on that analysis.</p>
                                <p>First, the physician might describe symptoms and other related factors to the system. Watson can then identify the key pieces of information and mine the patient’s data to find relevant facts about family history, current medications and other existing conditions. It combines this information with current findings from tests, and then forms and tests hypotheses by examining a variety of data sources—treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data and doctors’ and nurses’ notes, as well as peer-reviewed research and clinical studies. From here, Watson can provide potential treatment options and its confidence rating for each suggestion.</p>

                                <p>Healthcare and business professionals share their perspectives on the promise of Watson's transformative technology, and its ability to completely change how patients interact with caregivers and consumers with brands.

                                <h4>The challenge</h4>
                                <p>Disruption is everywhere in retail today. Customers, empowered by mobile devices and social networks that give them readier access to more information than ever before, have high expectations for service and satisfaction. And while today’s top retailers use Big Data to keep up with those expectations, their bigger challenge is efficiently and effectively analyzing this growing mountain of data for the insights that give them a competitive advantage.</p>
                                <p>With the power of IBM Watson’s cognitive computing, retailers can transform their business and re-imagine everything about the way they connect, transact, and engage with consumers.</p>
                                <h4>Solution</h4>
                                <p>Watson’s cognitive computing capabilities of analyzing massive amounts of unstructured data can help retailers reinvent their decision-making processes around pricing and purchasing. Today, a retailer using Watson can find insights in the data that might have escaped their notice, rather than relying on gut instinct.</p>
                                <p>Further, Watson’s unique ability to understand and answer questions in natural language makes it a cost-effective and scalable tool for analyzing and responding precisely to social sentiment, such as social interactions, blogs and customer reviews. And like a human being, Watson learns from experience and improves with feedback.</p>
                                <p>Watson can help draw insights from reams of unstructured information to help deliver a better experience. When a retailer understands its customers’ needs in greater detail, it can offer those customers more personalized and more satisfying experiences, increasing loyalty and conversions.</p>

                                <p>For local, regional and national government, the exponential rise of Big Data presents an enormous dilemma.</p>
                                <p>Today’s citizens are more informed and empowered than ever, and that means they have high expectations for the value of the public sector serving them.

                                <p>IBM Watson’s cognitive computing may help make sense of this data deluge, speeding governments’ decision-making processes and helping public employees focus on innovation and discovery.</p>

                                <p>Cognitive computing can help improve the service of the public sector in several ways, improving on slow and manual decision-making processes by employing such capabilities as decision-management, predictive and content analytics, planning, discovery, information integration and data management.</p>
                                <p>And Watson learns like a human. As it refines its own knowledge from its findings in vast sets of data and its interactions with the employees using it, it helps public employees improve process and policy.</p>
                                <p>Watson helps deliver personal service to citizens navigating complex processes. From these interactions, Watson learns the priorities of the public and helps inform policies that serve those interests. And with threats to security an ongoing problem, Watson can uncover patterns of activity that can help an agency interpret and address abnormal usage that may suggest an emerging problem.</p>
