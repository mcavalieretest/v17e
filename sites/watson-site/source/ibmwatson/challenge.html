                            <p>Start by capturing a mobile app idea that would benefit from Watson’s unique capabilities. It might be a brand new app, or perhaps an enhancement on an existing one. Next, create a proposal and submit it online. IBM will select finalists who will get access to Watson technology to build a prototype of their app. Five finalists will be invited to pitch their app to IBM leadership.</p>

                            <p>Winners will be invited to join the <a href="ecosystem.html?cmp=usbrb&cm=s&csr=watson.site_20140226&cr=dev&ct=usbrb301&cn=sec2cta" data-evname="deveco">Watson Ecosystem</a> and receive support from the Watson team and design services from the award-winning consultancy IBM Interactive to refine their app and bring it to market.</p>

While you are certainly welcome to apply to both, applying to only one does not also enter you into the other.

                                                    Watson understands questions posed in conversational language and return answers in the same form.
                                                    <br />Watson generates hypotheses based on the question asked, and returns answers with weighted confidence and links to the evidence behind each response.
                                                    <br />Watson learns from experience and gets smarter through every interaction.

This enables better customer engagement, new insight from data, and democratizing expert knowledge to the end customer. While our partners have already begun to demonstrate this in healthcare and retail, we view Watson as a way to disrupt industries broadly.
