								<h3>Member Resources</h3>
								<p>Ecosystem members are given access to a wealth of resources to help them create their applications built with Watson.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="ibm-columns">
							<div class="ibm-col-6-2">
								<h4>Watson Developer Cloud</h4>
								<p>As a Watson Developer, you’re given access to technology, tools and APIs, including training and ways to develop and test your applications built with Watson. Initially, the IBM team will be working with a limited number of partners, with plans of offering broader access to Ecosystem resources in the future. Learn how you can <a data-evname="devaccess" target="_blank" href="https://www.ibmdw.net/watson/request-access/">be one of the first to have access</a> when technical content is made available.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="ibm-col-6-2">
								<h4>Watson Content Store</h4>
								<p>Building an application that’s built with Watson requires the right kind of data and content. The Watson Content Store makes this possible by bringing together different sources of data for developers and content providers, including general knowledge, industry-specific content and subject matter expertise.
								</p>
								<p>&nbsp;</p>
								<h4>Watson Talent Hub</h4>
								<p>It's important to have access to the right people with the right skill sets to build a cognitive application. Whether it’s machine learning, user experience design or analytics, Ecosystem members can work with Watson experts on a fee or project basis.
								</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="ibm-col-6-2">
								<h4>Direct investments</h4>
								<p>The goal of the Watson Ecosystem is to nurture and support partners in developing commercial applications that incorporate Watson’s cognitive computing capabilities and collaborate on new commercial uses for Watson. To that end, IBM will invest $100M in select companies that develop a solution on Watson technology. As invested portfolio companies, partners can gain access to IBM’s technology, expertise, channels and client relationships.</p>
								<p>Criteria for equity investment include company size and growth rate, the ability of the application to positively disrupt and spur innovation in a market or industry, and level of committed resources. </p>

								<h4>Application Partners</h4>
								<p>The IBM Watson Ecosystem program is intended for companies interested in embedding Watson’s capability into their offerings to create a transformative cognitive app. For example, through the Watson Developer Cloud, a consumer-oriented application could deliver a personalized selling experience that replicates an in-store experience. Or, an airline could create a virtual travel agent app that recommends the perfect destination based on customer preferences.</p>
							</div>
							
							<div class="ibm-col-6-2">
								<h4>Content Partners</h4>
								<p>The program is perfect for companies that have extensive amounts of data, but few good ways to share or monetize it. Likely candidates fitting this description are:
								
								<ul>
								<li>organizations that have the rights to use and/or license general and domain-specific content.</li> 
								<li>information-based organizations, like publishers, researchers, and even social forums can take advantage of the Watson Content Store.</li>
								<li>organizations providing access to conventional data sources, representing billions of pages, including reports, publications, user-group logs, clinical trial data, call center recordings or product manuals, that could help fuel a new generation of cognitive apps.</li>
								</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							
							<div class="ibm-col-6-2">
								<h4>Talent Partners</h4>
								<p>Want to be recognized as a Watson expert by your peers?  We’re working on a multi-talent-level certification program, which we plan to offer later in 2014.</p>
