								<h4>The challenge</h4>
								<p>People expect companies to know who they are, how to engage with them and how to exceed their expectations, quickly. Case in point, research says that customers who contact a company via social media expect a response within five minutes. Companies doing all of the above will reap the benefits—it’s a fact that fully engaged customers deliver a 23% premium in share of wallet, profitability, revenue and relationship growth. That said, most organizations aren’t engaging with or meeting the needs of customers—when it’s never been easier to do so because of the availability of customer data. </p>
							</div>
							<div class="ibm-col-6-2">
								<h4>Solution</h4>
								<p>Watson can transform the way people and companies interact with one another. Individual consumers can engage with Watson in plain English, directly. to get personalized answers to questions.</p>
								<p>A bank, for instance, might use Watson to engage with customers to help them understand the types of accounts available and to facilitate the opening of the one that meets their particular needs. </p>
								<p>Barriers are lowered. Customers are served and engaged. Turnover is reduced. And new sales and relationship opportunities are created.  Everyone wins.</p>

								<h5>Don't just meet customers' expectations. Exceed them. </h5>
								<p>In an age when customers demand more, give them more via IBM Watson Engagement Advisor. This cognitive technology helps you know what customers want, engage them in ways they like, even empower customers at the point of action. How might Watson empower your customers – and you?

								<h4>The challenge</h4>
								<p>According to one expert, only 20 percent of the knowledge physicians use to diagnose and treat patients today is evidence based. Which means that one in five diagnoses is incorrect or incomplete.</p>
								<p>And consider that the amount of medical information available is doubling every five years and that much of this data is unstructured. Physicians simply don't have time to read every journal that can help them keep up to date with the latest advances. Given the growing complexity of medical decision making, how can healthcare providers address these problems?</p>
							</div>
							<div class="ibm-col-6-2">
								<h4>Solution</h4>
								<p>Watson has the potential to transform healthcare research, how medical students learn and how payments are processed.</p>
								<p>Physicians can use Watson to assist in diagnosing and treating patients by having it analyze large amounts of unstructured text and develop hypotheses based on that analysis.</p>
								<p>First, the physician might describe symptoms and other related factors to the system. Watson can then identify the key pieces of information and mine the patient’s data to find relevant facts about family history, current medications and other existing conditions. It combines this information with current findings from tests, and then forms and tests hypotheses by examining a variety of data sources—treatment guidelines, electronic medical record data and doctors’ and nurses’ notes, as well as peer-reviewed research and clinical studies. From here, Watson can provide potential treatment options  and its confidence rating for each suggestion.</p>

								<ul>
									<li>customer experiences via cost-effective, personalized advice, increasing customer satisfaction and attracting new capital. Watson is already starting to be used in customer service and as a wealth advisor.</li>

									<li>financial analysis and make analysts more productive and insightful through the vast amount of information it analyzes. Watson can also answer open-ended questions asked by users based on the data it has consumed.</li>

									<li>risk management and compliance by evaluating all cases against approved policies and guidelines and by understanding the complexities of risk exposure.</li>
