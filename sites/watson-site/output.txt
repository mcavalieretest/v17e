    <b>IBM PRESENTS THE 2014 "WATSON MOBILE INNOVATION CHALLENGE"</b>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <b> CONTEST OFFICIAL RULES</b>
</p>
<p>
    <b>NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN.</b>
    Internet access is required to enter.
</p>
<p>
    1. <b>DESCRIPTION</b>: The IBM Presents the 2014 "Watson Mobile Innovation Challenge" is a skill-based contest ("Contest") designed
    to drive awareness and interest in the Watson ecosystem and IBM MobileFirst portfolio by providing assistance to independent software vendors (ISVs) and
    their employee developers who want to build and take to market a commercial mobile application that leverages the Watson platform and Mobile technology.
    The Contest will have three phases operating over several months where participations will first submit an idea, finalists will develop a Prototype and
    video presentation of their idea, top finalists will develop a presentation for a live session with the Judges, and the winners will be provided access to
    Watson and support to build their final mobile applications.
</p>
<p>
    2. <b>SPONSOR</b>: The Contest is sponsored by International Business Machines Corp. ("IBM" or "Sponsor"), with its principal place
    of business at: 1 New Orchard Road, Armonk, N.Y. 10504, USA.
</p>
<p>
3. <b>BINDING AGREEMENT</b>: By submitting an entry, you agree to be bound by these Official Rules (available at    <a href="http://www.ibmwatson.com/">www.ibmwatson.com</a> ("Website")) and all Contest related communications from the Sponsor (collectively
    the "Rules"), and the decisions of the Sponsor and Judges which are final and binding in all respects. Please read the Rules prior to entry.
After reading the Rules and in order to participate, each Participant must click the "I understand and agree" box on the Contest entry Webpage. Once the Participant clicks the "I understand and agree" box, the Rules form a binding legal agreement between each Participant and Sponsor
    with respect to the Contest and the entry submissions in whole and in part at any time during the Contest (referred to herein as an "entry, "
    the "app" or "application" and/or "submission") made by the Participant. Participants may not submit an entry into the
    Contest and are not eligible to receive the Prizes described in these Rules unless they agree to be bound to the Rules.

    notification, prize award and fulfillment, who will be required to execute all Release Documents on behalf of the business entity. Only one (1) Prize will be awarded per Entry. By submitting an app on behalf of a business entity, entrants affirmatively agree that they have been asked
    to do so on behalf of their employer, and any Prize award will be provided to the business entity and not the individual who submitted the app. The same
    submission cannot be entered into this Contest more than one time, by more than one Participant, and in such event, one or both Participants and one or
    both submissions may be disqualified. Promotion Entities disclaim all responsibility and liability relating to all of the above; by entering Participants
    agree to release, indemnify, defend and hold them harmless in all respects relating thereto.

    implications, government and any other limitations (collectively "policies") regarding Participant's eligibility to participate in
    promotions and/or receive Prizes in connection therewith. Furthermore, if a Participant enters without obtaining the appropriate approvals, or if an
    individual is participating in violation of any such policies, Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, disqualify the Participant and forfeit their Prize, if
    applicable. Promotion Entities disclaim all responsibility and liability relating to the above; by entering Participants agree to release, indemnify,
    defend and hold them harmless in all respects thereto.

    Assuming sufficient eligible entries are received, it is anticipated that twenty-five (25) Finalists will be selected based on their highest combined score
    in accordance with the Judging Criteria for Phase I. Sponsor reserves the right to select fewer than (25) Finalists due to insufficient eligible entries,
    entries that fail to meet a minimum score based on the above <a>criteria</a>, or are otherwise lacking, or may select more than (25) if found to be of exceptional quality in Sponsor's sole and absolute discretion.
</p>
<p>
    After the announcement of the Finalists, the proposed ideas will be posted publicly on the Website with the opportunity for the broader community to
    comment, question, and ultimately rate the ideas. The public rating system is only a community feature, and will not have a material effect on Phase II
    Judging.
</p>
<p>
    Subject to verification and compliance, during the applicable Development Period each eligible Finalist will be assigned a 24 hour period for access to a
    special Watson sandbox and APIs to develop a prototype of their app idea entry ("Prototype" collectively referred to as an "entry"
    or "submission"). In addition, after completing the Prototype, Participants will be asked to submit a video presentation demonstrating their
    Prototype ("Video"). The Video should be less than 5 minutes, and should be in English. The Video is a "VC-type" pitch that showcases the
    concept, Prototype, and go-to-market plans for the app. Video format must be in .mov, or .mp4, and size 50 MB or less. Sponsor reserves the right to
    publish and share the Video, so the Video must not contain any confidential or proprietary information of Participant.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Phase II Judging Criteria: </b>
    The Prototypes and Video will be judged in addition to the original app <a>idea</a> based on the following:

    <b>Final (5) Finalists Selection: </b>
    the top five (5) Finalists with the highest combined score in accordance with the Judging Criteria for Phase II will be invited to demonstrate their
    Prototype and pitch their concept in a live session with IBM judges ("live session"). The live session will take place virtually over the
    internet, and the selected top Finalists must present the same content that was included in their Video. The presentation will be augmented by live Q&A
    with the Judges. The top five (5) Finalists and all entry elements, which will also now include the live session, will be judged again in accordance with
    the Judging Criteria for Phase II and two (2) potential Grand Prize winners will be selected based on the highest combined score, subject to verification
    and compliance.
</p>
<p>
In the case of a tie, the tie will be broken (among the tied entries within the applicable Phase) by the highest combined score(s) in the [4m__________[24m    <a>criteria</a>
   (for Phase I tied entries), or in the [4m___________[24m criteria (for Phase II tied entries), and if a tie still remains the tie will be broken (among the
    remaining tied entries for the applicable Phase) by the entry with the highest score in the [4m__________[24m criteria (in Phase I) or by the entry with the
    highest score in the [4m__________[24m criteria (in Phase II). If any Participant selected as a potential Prize recipient for a given Prize is disqualified for
    any reason, the next highest-scoring Participant in that Phase, as applicable, will be designated as the potential Finalist or recipient of that respective
    Prize, as applicable. In the event any Finalist is disqualified, forfeits the opportunity to continue in the Contest, or is otherwise unable or unwilling
    to participate, an alternate Finalist may be selected (in Sponsor's sole discretion and only if fair and sufficient time exists) based on score for
    the applicable Phase.
